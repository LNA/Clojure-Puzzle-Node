PuzzleNode is a site for coders who enjoy to work on challenging problems, and is inspired by similar efforts such as Project Euler and the Internet Problem Solving Contest . Once upon a time it also served as an entrance exam of sorts for folks looking to join Mendicant University.

This project was developed, maintained, and supported by Mendicant University students and staff until the school changed directions and put a hold on all existing projects, including PuzzleNode. If you are interested in jump starting this project just open a ticket in our issue tracker to get the ball rolling.

Happy hacking!
